# ðŸš€ Hello Retrocketeer, welcome!

In this project we will ask you to develop a simple frontend project using Next.js.

Time required: 1-3 Hours (Approximately)

## Project Description

### NextPress
NextPress is a basic news portal and has a very simple structure. In this project, we will ask you to setup the frontend which should satisfy the project requirements given below.

#### Project Details:
- The main page will have a header area. This area should contain links Home Page and Authors directories.
- The body of the main page will contain the recent posts. These posts will be listed as cards.
- These listed cards should be paginated. You can fetch the posts from the following path: ```/posts/1.json```
- Cards must be reusable components.
- In addition, there should be author information at the bottom of the card.
- Clicking on the card should display its details. For example, you can find the details of the first card from the following path: ```/post-details/1.json```
- Right below the recent posts should be the recently viewed content.
- When a user views a content appropriate data should be stored in the browser and the content should be visible in recently viewed section.

Design decisions and architectural pattern to be followed within the project is totally up to you, please do impress us :)

- You can clone or fork this repository for your submission.

Best of luck!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
